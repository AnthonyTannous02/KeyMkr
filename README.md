# Information Security Project: True Random Number Generator Website

## Purpose
This project serves as a Demo for two True Random Generator Methods:
- Lava Lamps
- Mouse Movements

## Languages and Frameworks
- Python Flask
- React.js

## Launching the Project
The steps are as follows:
### Preparing Files
  1. Download a Lava Lamp Video or any video from youtube into mp4.
  2. Place it into public/static named LavaLampVid.mp4
  3. The YT will be found in the README.md file in the public/static directory.
### Running the Code
  1. Start by installing the needed NPM packages:
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  2. Create a Python Virtual Environment:
  ```
  virtualenv env
  ```
  3. Activate the Virtual Environment (Depends on you OS)
  4. Install Python dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  5. Run the Python code by running main.py
  6. Run the react code by typing in the console:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ``` 

## My Contribution
I worked on designing the front end of the website. I also created the Lava Lamps algorithm and functionalities. Finally, I linked all the algorithms with the front end using the Flask Framework and IO Sockets.
