# Information Security Project: True Random Number Generator Website

## Purpose
This project serves as a Demo for two True Random Generator Methods:
- Lava Lamps
- Mouse Movements

## Languages and Frameworks
- Python Flask
- React.js

## Launching the Project
The steps are as follows:
1. Start by installing the needed NPM packages:
```

2. Create a Python Virtual Environment:
```
virtualenv env
```
3. Activate the Virtual Environment (Depends on you OS)
4. Install Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the Python code by running main.py
6. Run the react code by typing in the console:
```
npm run dev
``` 

## My Contribution:
I worked on designing the front end of the website. I also created the Lava Lamps algorithm and functionalities. Finally, I linked all the algorithms with the front end using the Flask Framework and IO Sockets.
